# TorrentDownloader
a js script that searches in 1337x for torrents letting you pick and download them

before you need to install dependencies
```npm i axios cheerio fs torrent-stream```

simply if Windows run
``` node ./download.js <the torrent you want>```

in linux i suggest adding it to the system commands running
```sudo cp ./download /usr/local/bin/torrentDownloader```
then run it like that
```torrentDownloader <the torrent you want>```
